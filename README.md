The URL amqp://guest:guest@localhost:5672 is used to connect to a message broker, which in this case is configured to run on the local machine. Here, the first 'guest' is the username and the second 'guest' is the password for the RabbitMQ server. The localhost:5672 specifies that the RabbitMQ server is running locally on port 5672, which is the default port for RabbitMQ.
